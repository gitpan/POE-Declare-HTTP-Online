NAME
    POE::Declare::HTTP::Online - Does your POE process have access to the
    web

SYNOPSIS
        my $online = POE::Declare::HTTP::Online->new(
            Timeout      => 10,
            OnlineEvent  => \&handle_online,
            OfflineEvent => \&handle_offline,
            ErrorEvent   => \&handle_unknown,
        );
        
    $online->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a port of LWP::Online to POE::Declare. It behaves similarly to
    the original, except that it does not depend on LWP and can execute the
    HTTP probes in parallel.

  new
        my $online = POE::Declare::HTTP::Online->new(
            Timeout      => 10,
            OnlineEvent  => \&handle_online,
            OfflineEvent => \&handle_offline,
            ErrorEvent   => \&handle_unknown,
        );

    The "new" constructor sets up a reusable HTTP online status checker that
    can be run as often as needed.

    Unless actively in use, the online detection object will not consume a
    POE session.

  run
    The "run" method starts the online detection process, spawning the POE
    session and initiating HTTP Test to each of the test URLs in parallel.

    Once a determination has been made as to our online state (positive,
    negative or unknown) and the reporting event has been fired, the session
    will be terminated immediately.
